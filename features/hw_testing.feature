Feature: Testing instructor created homeworks
  In order to check that the supplied homework can be graded by AutoGrader
  As a AutoGrader maintainer
  I would like these homeworks to be automatically tested on submit

  Background: The project structure is there
    Given that I am in the project root directory "hw-tests"
    And that there is an autograders directory "rag"
    And that there is a homeworks directory "hw"

  Scenario: Checks the homeworks file structure
    When I check each homeworks directory
    Then I should see a directory "autograder" with at least one file
    And I should see a directory "public" with at least one file
    And I should see a directory "solutions" with at least one file
    #And no empty directories or no loose files?

  Scenario: Checks that all necessary files are present
    When I check the autograders directory
    Then I should see an autograder directory "spec" with unit tests
    And I should see an autograder directory "features" with integration tests
    And I should see an autograder directory "log" where logs are output

  Scenario: confirms AutoGrader setup
    Given I delete all the autograder log files
    And I run cucumber in "rag"
    Then I should see a log directory "assign-0-part-1-submissions" has 8 files

  Scenario: Runs an AutoGrader grading process on supplied homework
    Given I have a homework "ruby-intro"
    And I run the AutoGrader on this homework
    Then I should see the test results output
    And I should see no runtime errors
    And I should see that the process succeeded

  Scenario: Checks that the supplied files are of correct format

  Scenario: AutoGrader run results are visible in Travis

  Scenario: AutoGrader runs test grading process for all homeworks in the repo
