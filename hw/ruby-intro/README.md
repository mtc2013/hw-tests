Ruby intro
==========

This homework provides a gentle intro to Ruby by having the students
write various "bare" methods (so they effectively become methods of
`Object`) to do simple tasks with arrays, strings, and regular
expressions. 

Sanity specs are provided in `public/spec`.  The `public/README.md` file
for students explains how to run them, assuming `rspec` is installed.
